A Railway Reservation project with seat selection GUI in java(application)
PS-Still working on improving the GUI and some fuctionality. Also working on making the code readable.(Created on ecclipse)
The code for the database is in a notepad file, to be copied to MySQL.
The booking system works well. Has functioanlaity to view previous journies, the train chart, cancel a ticket and check the pnr status.
The database has only few trains added to it and the person has to search for stations using the station code. 
All trains have their original working days, number of coaches and seats.
No option for RAC/ Waiting List currently.
A limit for booking is restricted to 10 days. 
If a seat is not booked for ta specific day fo a perticular train, a new table is created in the database automatically and the seats can be seleted,
else it makes changes in the existing table. 
Database has 4 static tables and others are dynamically created.
I know that a lot of work is still to be done so suggestions and constructive criticism will be appreciated.
